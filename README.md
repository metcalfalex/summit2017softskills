Notes from EYC3 2017 Summit - sessions on soft skills

Presented by Toby Travaner

## Networking

### How to sell yourself

#### Wing man FTW

Australian tall poppy syndrome means you need someone else to sing your praises.

Acceptable: Have you met Nick? He's a gun developer. Great in python, SQL, tableau, and has a great head for stats.

Who are you trying to sell to?  
Who can sell to them on your behalf?  
How can you coach that person to sell you?  

#### Disguising credibility

"When I was first made a partner 9 years ago, it was quite different dealing with Westfield back then."

### People who matter

#### Colleagues

Interact on a personal level

#### Clients

Add value (non-project related) e.g. industry gossip, technical subject 101, things we've learnt using your data

#### External peer network

Join relevant professional body
Get involved with talks and white papers

#### Prospective clients

Traditional business development

### Making it stick

When planning your elevator pitch, prioritise stories and case studies over facts and figures

### Small talk

Open ended questios -> What else? -> drill down

## Effective presentations

### Designing messages with impact

Importance:  
Verbal - the words I use (7%)  
Vocal - tone and quality (38%)  
Visual - what is seen (55%)  

### Create memorability

Refresh - Summary. "Let me remind you..."  
Repeat - e.g. "Actionable insights"  
Refrain - A common repeated theme  

### Lost trains of thought

"I've just lost my train of thought, let me recap. First we spoke about..."

### Emphasis

Contrast volume, pitch or tempo to emphasise a point.

### Physcial aspect

Make gestures biger x 2  
Bigger gestures -> bigger emotions -> bigger vocal + delivery

### Achoring to avoid cognitive dissonance

"On one hand" -> move to that side of the room  
Match presentation to any visuals
